## func.pathway takes a starting station and end station and returns the subway lines needed to connect the two stations
## usage: Rscript subway_algorithm.R Mattapan Airport ; interactive: func.pathway("Mattapan", "Airport")

## step 1: given any two correctly spelled start and end stations, extract their subway line
## once you know the subway lines, you can simply treat each line as a node; the hubs will determine their connectivity; for the purposes of this exercise, this approach is much simpler than treating each station as a node
## there are three scenarios to consider: 1) both stations are in the same line (e.g., Harvard, Alewife); 2) different lines, but 1 degree of separation based on hubs (e.g., Harvard, Arlington); 3) differnt lines with > 1 degree of separation. this will require changing lines more than once (e.g., Harvard, Airport)
